# Bare-Metal-TM4C1294NCPDT
This repository is an integrated development envoriment for Linux users to develop using CLI to flash and compile to TM4C1294NCDPT. This project is fully integrated with newlib and hardware floating point unit. The semi-hosting is not enabled but you can change the code to enable the semi hosting , all you need is inside the **Makefile.conf**.

# Requirements
* [arm-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [openocd](https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd)

# Folder structure
* **ldscripts** is a folder that holds the description about memory organization and divisions.
* **include** is a folder that holds all the header files, the Makefile maps this folder as root of include, so if you need to add another folder with header file so you need write as following **#include "folder/header.h"**.
* **lib** in this folder I will store all the pre compiled libs for example tx.a that is RTOS pre-compiled lib.
* **objects** objects files generated by the compilation process.
* **src** This folder contains the source code of all firmware.

# Use

* To build the project just type .
```shell
> make
```



* To open the openocd host type.
```shell
>  make load
```

*  To clean the project type. 
```shell
>  make clean
```

if you type **make load** then you must open another terminal and start the arm-none-eabi-gdb.

* To start debug session type.
```shell
> arm-none-eabi-gdb
```

* To connect to the target type 
```shell
(gdb) > target remote localhost:3333
```


* To reset type.
```shell
(gdb) > monitor reset init
```

* To flash the chip type.
```shell
(gdb) > monitor flash write_image erase blink.elf
```

* If you wish only reset the chip and leaves tha application running just type.

```shell
(gdb) > monitor reset
```

* If you wish reset and halt the application type .

```shell
(gdb) > monitor reset halt
```

for more information about the use of gdb you can read the documentation on https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/
